## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a multilingual, AI-based mobile application named "Kisan-Mitra," which translates to "Farmer's Friend." This app will serve as a comprehensive, digital advisory platform specifically designed for small and marginal farmers. The key is to make it incredibly user-friendly for people with low digital literacy. To achieve this, the app will feature a voice-first interface, allowing farmers to simply speak their questions in their native language and receive spoken responses. This eliminates the need for extensive reading or typing. The app will also include a simple, icon-based design and will be available on Android, the most common smartphone OS in rural India.


## Technical Approach
The system's technical foundation is a hybrid model that uses both on-device processing and powerful cloud services. The mobile app's front-end will handle user interactions and voice commands. The back-end, hosted on a scalable cloud platform like Google Cloud or AWS, will be the powerhouse. It will run AI and machine learning models, including a custom-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for the conversational chatbot and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identifying pests and diseases from uploaded images. The system will also integrate with various external APIs to pull in real-time data on weather, market prices, and soil health. This ensures the advice is always timely, accurate, and relevant to the farmer's specific location and needs.
## Feasibility and Viability
This project is highly feasible and viable due to several key factors. The core technologies—AI, cloud computing, and mobile app development—are mature and widely accessible. Open-source tools can be leveraged to keep development costs down. The demand is massive, as an estimated 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal and increasingly adopting smartphones. Furthermore, the Indian government's "Digital Agriculture Mission" provides a supportive policy framework. The system can be sustained through partnerships with government agencies, agricultural cooperatives, and non-profits, or through a freemium model where basic features are free and advanced services are paid.

## Impact and Benefits
The "Kisan-Mitra" system can have a transformative impact on the agricultural sector. For farmers, it can lead to a significant 20-30% increase in crop yield and a reduction in input costs by promoting the optimal use of fertilizers and pesticides. This directly boosts their income and improves their livelihood. The app also benefits the environment by encouraging sustainable farming practices. For government agencies and NGOs, the platform offers a powerful tool for efficient outreach and data collection, which can be used to inform policy and resource allocation.

## Research and References
The foundation of this solution is built upon existing research and verified data. The NABARD Report (2022) confirms the massive target audience of small and marginal farmers. Numerous studies have shown that ICT-based agricultural advisories are highly effective at increasing crop productivity. Government initiatives like the Digital Agriculture Mission (DAM) and AgriStack are actively creating a digital public infrastructure that this solution can seamlessly integrate with. Finally, the success of existing agritech startups provides a clear proof-of-concept for this type of digital solution in the Indian market.
